# Fair Fairness Benchmark: course project workspace

This repository organizes the published [Fair Fairness Benchmark (FFB)](https://github.com/ahxt/fair_fairness_benchmark) code alongside our group's reproduction work and two supporting tools. The original benchmark is a framework for evaluating in-processing group fairness methods. Our work here is an extension and organization of that code, not a claim that we reproduced every result in the paper.

## Progress at a glance

| Workstream | What is in the repository | Current status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FFB reference code | Original training scripts, models, metrics, dataset instructions, tutorial, and figures under [`ffb/`](ffb/) | Available as the baseline; the original paper's figures and running logs are upstream results, not new group results. |
| CelebA reproduction | Four ResNet-18/ResNet-20 runners for ERM and DiffDP under [`ffb/reproduce/`](ffb/reproduce/) | Scripts and a dependency/data preflight are implemented. No completed run output is committed; training still needs the CelebA data and dependencies. |
| PDF evaluation-metric extractor | [`team/eval_metrics_tool/`](team/eval_metrics_tool/) | Rule-based PDF text/table extraction, metric matching, and ranking are implemented. Scanned PDFs and some table layouts remain unsupported. |
| Local repository agent | [`team/agent/`](team/agent/) | A basic Ollama/LangChain agent can list the available reproduction scripts. It is not yet an automated experiment runner. |

The code in `ffb/src/`, `ffb/benchmark/`, `ffb/datasets/`, `ffb/tutorial/`, and `ffb/img/` comes from the [upstream FFB project](https://github.com/ahxt/fair_fairness_benchmark). The `ffb/reproduce/` scripts and both folders under `team/` are this group's additions. See the [FFB paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09468) for the benchmark's methods and published results.

## Try the current work

Run the following commands from the repository root. Each component has its own requirements; the data and Ollama model are not included in the repository.

### Check CelebA reproduction readiness

```bash
python ffb/reproduce/reproduce_resnet18_celeba.py --check
```

This prints whether `ffb/datasets/celeba/raw/celeba.csv` and the required Python packages are present. To prepare the data, follow [`ffb/datasets/readme.md`](ffb/datasets/readme.md). After preparation, the ERM and DiffDP entry points include:

```bash
python ffb/reproduce/reproduce_resnet18_celeba.py --weights random
python ffb/reproduce/reproduce_diffdp_resnet18_celeba.py --weights random
python ffb/reproduce/reproduce_resnet20_celeba.py
python ffb/reproduce/reproduce_diffdp_resnet20_celeba.py
```

These are partial reproduction runners with a default 20,000-row sample and 150 training steps. They write local outputs under `ffb/results/`, which is ignored by Git. We have not committed numerical results, so please do not interpret the published FFB results in [`ffb/readme.md`](ffb/readme.md) as results from these runs. The original `ffb/requirements.txt` pins CUDA-specific PyTorch builds; those pins may need platform-specific installation on macOS or a non-CUDA machine.

### Extract evaluation metrics from a paper

```bash
python -m pip install -r team/eval_metrics_tool/requirements.txt
cd team/eval_metrics_tool
python -m eval_metrics /path/to/paper.pdf --top-k 5
```

The extractor returns ranked metric names based on mentions in the PDF; it does not compute benchmark scores. Its [README](team/eval_metrics_tool/README.md) explains the scoring rules and limitations. The development requirements list test dependencies, but no test suite is currently committed.

### Run the local agent

The agent needs Python 3.12, a running [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) service, and the `qwen3:4b` model. From the repository root:

```bash
ollama pull qwen3:4b
python -m pip install -r team/agent/requirements.txt
python team/agent/basic_agent.py
```

The agent currently answers one demonstration question by calling a tool that lists files in `ffb/reproduce/`. See its [README](team/agent/README.md) for the recommended virtual environment setup.
